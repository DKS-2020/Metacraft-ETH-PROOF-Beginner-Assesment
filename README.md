Nexus Token Smart Contract

This is a Solidity smart contract in which we can mint and burn tokens. I have created my own token, known as Nexus, with the abbreviation NXS. This code allows minting any amount of tokens as per requirements and also burning tokens according to needs.It also make sure that the balance of account is greater than or equal to the amount that is supposed to be burned. It's a very basic code that can easily give you an understanding of how to mint and burn tokens in Solidity.
